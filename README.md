# estate-repos

**estate-repos** is a repository designed to automate the creation and management of repositories within the [evoteum](https://github.com/evoteum) organization. It leverages [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) to apply infrastructure-as-code principles, enabling seamless repository provisioning and configuration.

## Features

- **Automated Repository Creation**: Simply add the repository name, description, and any required attributes to `repos.yaml`.
- **Consistent Configuration**: Ensures all repositories follow organizational standards.
- **Scalable and Flexible**: Easily add and modify repositories as needed.


## Usage
### Creating repos

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/evoteum/estate-repos.git
   cd estate-repos
   ```

2. **Define Repositories**:
   - Open `repos.yaml` and add new repositories with attributes like:
     ```yaml
     - name: my-new-repo
       description: "A new project for evoteum."
       visibility: private
       topics:
         - devops
         - automation
     ```

3. **Push the change**

After a few seconds, the new repository will be created in the evoteum organization.

### Archiving repos

We do not delete repositories, as they may contain valuable information, so do not remove repos from repos.yaml. Instead, archive them by simply adding `archived: true` to the repository definition in `repos.yaml`.

## Repository Variables in repos.yaml

Each repository entry in repos.yaml can include the following variables:
